# House_Price_Prediction

House price prediction is a common problem in the real estate industry. Predicting the prices accurately can help homeowners, 
real estate agents, and investors make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can estimate 
house prices based on various factors such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.

## Scope

This project is aimed at predicting house prices based on various features and factors. The goal is to develop a simple regression model
using XGBoost that can accurately estimate the prices of houses given a set of input variables.
